            the Yoctopuce library.

            From an operating system standpoint, it is generally not required to call
            this function since the OS will automatically free allocated resources
            once your program is completed. However, there are two situations when
            you may really want to use that function:

            - Free all dynamically allocated memory blocks in order to
            track a memory leak.

            - Send commands to devices right before the end
            of the program. Since commands are sent in an asynchronous way
            the program could exit before all commands are effectively sent.

            You should not call any other library function after calling
            yFreeAPI(), or your program will crash.

            """
            Set up the Yoctopuce library to use modules connected on a given machine. Idealy this
            call will be made once at the begining of your application.  The
            parameter will determine how the API will work. Use the following values:

            <b>usb</b>: When the usb keyword is used, the API will work with
            devices connected directly to the USB bus. Some programming languages such a JavaScript,
            PHP, and Java don't provide direct access to USB hardware, so usb will
            not work with these. In this case, use a VirtualHub or a networked YoctoHub (see below).

            <b><i>x.x.x.x</i></b> or <b><i>hostname</i></b>: The API will use the devices connected to the
            host with the given IP address or hostname. That host can be a regular computer
            running a <i>native VirtualHub</i>, a <i>VirtualHub for web</i> hosted on a server,
            or a networked YoctoHub such as YoctoHub-Ethernet or
            YoctoHub-Wireless. If you want to use the VirtualHub running on you local
            computer, use the IP address 127.0.0.1. If the given IP is unresponsive, yRegisterHub
            will not return until a time-out defined by ySetNetworkTimeout has elapsed.
            However, it is possible to preventively test a connection  with yTestHub.
            If you cannot afford a network time-out, you can use the non-blocking yPregisterHub
            function that will establish the connection as soon as it is available.


            <b>callback</b>: that keyword make the API run in "<i>HTTP Callback</i>" mode.
            This a special mode allowing to take control of Yoctopuce devices
            through a NAT filter when using a VirtualHub or a networked YoctoHub. You only
            need to configure your hub to call your server script on a regular basis.
            This mode is currently available for PHP and Node.JS only.

            Be aware that only one application can use direct USB access at a
            given time on a machine. Multiple access would cause conflicts
            while trying to access the USB modules. In particular, this means
            that you must stop the VirtualHub software before starting
            an application that uses direct USB access. The workaround
            for this limitation is to set up the library to use the VirtualHub
            rather than direct USB access.

            If access control has been activated on the hub, virtual or not, you want to
            reach, the URL parameter should look like:

            http://username:password@address:port

            You can call <i>RegisterHub</i> several times to connect to several machines. On
            the other hand, it is useless and even counterproductive to call <i>RegisterHub</i>
            with to same address multiple times during the life of the application.

                    root URL of the hub to monitor
