    The YSensor class is the parent class for all Yoctopuce sensor types. It can be
    used to read the current value and unit of any sensor, read the min/max
    value, configure autonomous recording frequency and access recorded data.
    It also provides a function to register a callback invoked each time the
    observed value changes, or at a predefined interval. Using this class rather
    than a specific subclass makes it possible to create generic applications
    that work with any Yoctopuce sensor, even those that do not yet exist.
